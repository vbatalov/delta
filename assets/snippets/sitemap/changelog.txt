# 1.0.9 (2010-06-09) by ncrossland
- update metadata format for use in ModX 1.0.x installer
# 1.0.8 (2008-08-21)
- excludeTemplates can now also be specified as a template ID instead of template name. 
  Useful if you change the names of your templates frequently. (ncrossland)
  e.g. &excludeTemplates=`myTemplateName,3,4`
# 1.0.7 (2008-07-30)
- Unpublished and deleted documents were showing up in the sitemap. Even though they could not be viewed, 
  they were showing up as broken links to search engines. (ncrossland)
# 1.0.6 (2008-02-28)
- Add optional parameter (excludeWeblinks) to exclude weblinks from the sitemap, since they often point to external
  sites (which don't belong on your sitemap), or redirecting to other internal pages (which are already
  in the sitemap). Google Webmaster Tools generates warnings for excessive redirects.    
  Default is false - e.g. default behaviour remains unchanged. (ncrossland)
# 1.0.5 (2008-02-24)
- Modification about non searchable documents, as suggested by forum user JayBee
  (http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,5754.msg99895.html#msg99895)
# 1.0.4 (2008-02-06) by Bert Catsburg, bert@catsburg.com
- Added display option 'ulli'. 
  An <ul><li> list of all published documents.
# 1.0.3 (2007-05-16)
- Added ability to specify the XSL URL - you don't always need one and it 
  seems to create a lot of support confusion!
  It is now a parameter (&xsl=``) which can take either an alias or a doc ID (ncrossland)
- Modifications suggested by forum users Grad and Picachu incorporated
  (http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,5754.60.html)
# 1.0.2 (2006-07-12)
- Reworked fetching of template variable value to
  get INHERITED value.
# 1.0.1
- Reworked fetching of template variable value,
  now it gets computed value instead of nominal;
  however, still not the inherited value.
# 1.0
- First public release.

TODO:
- provide output for ROR
